Beyond the horizon 
of the place we lived when we were young
in a world of magnets and miracles

our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary.
the ringing of the division bell had begun.

along the long road and on down the causeway
do they still live there by the cut?

there was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
running before time took our dreams away

leaving the myriad small creatures 
trying to tie us to the ground
to a life consumed by slow decay

the grass was greener
the light was brighter
with friends surrounding 
the nights of wonder

looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
to a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
steps taken forwards but sleep walking back again
dragged by the force of some inner tide
at a higher altitude a flag unfurls
we reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
there's a hunger still unsatisified
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
go down this road we've been so many times.

the grass was greener
the light was brighter
the taste was sweeter
the nights of wonder

with friends surrounding
the dawn mist glowing
the water flowing
the endless river
forever and ever
